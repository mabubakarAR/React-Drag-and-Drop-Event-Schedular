  "description": "This example illustrates that react-big-calendar doesn't allow events to be dragged from one month to another. Today, you can only drag and drop onto a day that's already visible. We should add a way to trigger a drag from the current month to another month by implementing a hot zone to trigger a next or previous month transition.",
